### Upcoming Tasks:

[ DATE - matrix? ] A Goddamned Auction. Yes, I know all 11 of us are the coolest busiest guys in the world the the most children and wives and vacations blah blah, figure it out. 
If you want to be really cute, we can try Saturday 9/9 (Filach style). Contracts for future years are due within 48 hours of the auction.

[ DATE ] RFA / Rookie Contract Decisions.
Everyone on your team with a Guaranteed contract for 2017 and forward is already on your team. Everyone with an expired contract is going in the auction. Everyone with a Rookie Contract can be kept for a $5 raise, or cut. Everyone with a Droppable or RFA status can be kept for an $8 raise, or cut. Simple, right?

[ DATE ] Rookie Draft Lists Due.
There are 12 teams, There are 24 possible picks. Send me a list of 24 goddamn NFL players drafted this year and how many rookies you want. (Correct answers are 0, 1, or 2) A First Round pick will cost you $5. A Second round pick will cost you $1. And you have to keep them until after the auction.

##### RFA


RFA ROUND 1 BIDS due SUNDAY, MARCH 2 at 11:59 PM

The RFA process has been condensed into 1 week so we can start a bit later and have a bit more clarity from the Real Baseball side.  Also remember, it is each team's responsibility
to be the Salary police.  RFA works because the market prevents Andrew McCutchen from being kept for $8, general apathy leads to a broken league.  So bid early, bid often, and bid within your means.
It almost always works out in the end.


We call this round the Declaration of Interest.  You are free to submit a salary offer to darksidesports@gmail.com on any player, not on your team, that you have not traded this offseason, and that has a 2014 Resign value of RFA. (Please send the email with the Name of your Team and "RFA Bids" in the subject, and attach a document with the Names, and Current Owner of the players, along with your bid in the body)

This Salary offer must include at least a 10% raise, rounded up to the nearest dollar, on the 2013 salary.  An offer that fails to qualify on this point will be disqualified.

There is no limit on the number of players you may declare interest in.

If a player does not get an offer, the original owner has the choice of signing that player to a contract at a 10% raise, or releasing him into the Free Agent auction.

If a player gets only one offer, the original owner has the choice of matching it, and signing that player to a contract, or allowing the winning bidder to sign the player.

If a player gets multiple offers, they will be separated into Competitive and Insulting offers.  A Competitive offer is any offer within $10 of the highest tendered bid.  All teams that submitted a competitive offer will move on to Round 2 of RFA Bidding.  Teams that tendered insulting offers will be unable to continue bidding on the player.

Remember these bids constitute a binding agreement, if you have submitted the highest bid, and the original owner does not wish to match that bid, you will sign that player to at least a 1 year contract.


An illuminating example from 2013


The Pitcher Clayton Kershaw finished his Rookie Contract.  Leaving his salary at $5, pending a 10% raise

6 of the 11 other teams submitted a bid on Mr. Kershaw.  The lowest legal bid would have been $6

Bids of $28, $43, $30, $22, $30, and $35 were submitted.

That high bid of $43 set the top of the market, the team that submitted that bid was locked into it.  (He could improve the bid, but not withdraw it)

The Bids of $28, $30, $22, and $30 were disqualified, those teams were unable to continue bidding on Kershaw.

The bid of $35 had the choice of continuing to bid in round 2 (Higher than $43), or dropping out.

Kershaw's owner has the right to match whatever the high bid is at the end of Round 2, or letting him go to the highest bidder.

on the other hand

The hitter Chris Davis was marked as an RFA with a salary of $3, pending a 10% raise

Only 1 team submitted a bid on Mr. Davis.  It was for $4

Davis' owner chose to match that bid and kept Davis at a salary of $4 and lived happily ever after.
